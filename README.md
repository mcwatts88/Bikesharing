## Results

Trip Duration vs Number of Bikes:

Most bikes were used for less than 1 hour.

Trip Duration by Gender:

Men utilized bikes more than women.

Trips by Weekday:

Rush hour seemed to show the highest utilization.

Weekday Trips by Gender:

Gender did not have an effect on when bikes were used.

Customer Type:

Subscriptions were more popular than single use.

Customer Type Pie Chart:

Another view of customer type.

Bike Utilization:

A small number of bikes were utilized much more than others.

## Summary

Bike sharing was utilized by commuters in NYC. NYC is much more dense than Des Moines so if there is a significant distance to commute than bike utilization may be lower. Also bike lanes exist in NYC which may not be as prevalent in Des Moines. These two factors would need to be studied and addressed.
